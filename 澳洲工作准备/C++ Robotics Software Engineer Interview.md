C++ Robotics Software Engineer Interview



algorithmic/data structure:  doing leetcode with C++ 



问题可以参考：geeksforgeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus-gq/virtual-functions-gq/).

Other topics you should know/ questions I have been asked in the past:

- Difference between std::unordered_map and std::map
- What are smart pointers/ and implement one.
- How to use virtual functions? 
  - Generally they have some code with a base class calling the virtual function. And they ask you what it outputs.
- At a high level how are virtual functions implemented.
- Difference between reference and pointer
- Move/Copy semantics
- Iterators. Know how to use them and maybe implement one.
- Difference between struct and class
- Knowledge of constructors/ destructors
- Know how to use templates
- Rule of 3 or Rule of 5

The above are fair game for a reasonable company. I do know certain companies with a superiority complex will sometimes ask the following:

- What are the differences between C++ 11,14,17
- What is perfect forwarding
- What is SFINAE
- What is latest C++ feature XXXX and how is it implemented





学什么：

 I've worked with drones and when we could use python, we would. But when it comes to real-time processing, high performance such as vision, position control and so on, C++ was the language of choice.

Considering you are starting robotic engineering, I'd start with python to learn more about the concept and architecture of a robotic software before moving on to C++ for more specific applications.
